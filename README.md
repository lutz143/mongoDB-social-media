## Description
The MongoDB Social Media Backend is a use case for utilizing MongoDB as a noSQL approach in handling database calls and performing CRUD operations. The structure of this app builds an API for a social media network where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
